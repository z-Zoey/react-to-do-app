#### React-to-do-app

React-to-do-app, unsprisingly, is a very simple to-do-app built while I'm learning react. It has no database support.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I highly recommand the the tutorial found[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUz3k2O3ZJU&index=25&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ij8CfkAY2RAGb-tmkNwQHG).
